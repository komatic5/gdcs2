# 1: Animation Options

## Use Speed & Randomize Start
Randomize Start lets the animation start on a random frame. Use Speed lets you control the speed of the animation.

The starting speed will always be 1.00. You MUST have the “Use Speed” option selected in order to change the speed of the animation. 

To change the speed of the animation, move the slider to the right to make it faster, if you want it to be slower, move the slider to the left. Negative numbers cause the animation to play in reverse.

## Disable Delayed Loop
Some objects are delayed before looping; this option removes that delay. Many objects which disappear for a while before looping have this option.

## Disable AnimShine
This Disables the “white flash” shown before some animations.

## Single Frame & Offset Animation
Single Frame lets you pause an animation and select a specific frame from it. This can be useful if you wish to only use the shape from one frame of the object.

Offset Anim resumes the animations, but they’ll start at the frame you specified.

## Animate On Trigger & Only If Active
Animate On Trigger disables the animation on the object. It will only activate when it’s added to a group activated by an Animate Trigger.

Only If Active only enables animations on objects that are on-screen when the Animate Trigger activates them.

None

Finally, the monster animated objects at the start of the tab can be controlled using an Animate Trigger. These have special animation IDs, which are described in more depth [here](<https://discord.com/channels/414295025883545600/1086730690227355729/1152785673909182534>).
