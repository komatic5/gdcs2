- Slow speed gameplay is usually at 0.5x or 1x speed (sometimes 2x depending on the context). Good slow gameplay takes advantage of the fact that the player can see what’s coming.
- Slow gameplay gives you more opportunities to play around with gameplay and make more complex, less readable parts. Complex gameplay can use a variety of techniques to keep the player engaged and on their toes:
- Slopes
- Fake orbs, pads, and portals
- Gamemode switches

# 1: Why Slow Gameplay Matters

Generally, slow gameplay makes the player go at 0.5x or 1x speed, but it can include 2x speed depending on the surrounding gameplay. For instance, 2x speed will feel slow coming out of a 4x speed section. In contrast, 2x speed will feel fast when transitioning from 0.5x speed. 

Slow gameplay is also trickier to make, as some treat this as filler between intense sections. However, that's far from true. Not only does slow gameplay provide much-needed breaks from intense “drop” parts, but it creates contrast from those faster parts, leaving the player with a more fulfilling experience. 

Good slow gameplay takes advantage of the fact that the player can see what’s coming. Traps and gimmicks that may seem unfair at higher speeds become an interesting and unique challenge at slower ones. Making gameplay that isn’t as straightforward can also add to the contrast between slower and faster parts.

It’s generally recommended to use slow gameplay during calmer or slower parts of the song, but you can also use *slower* gameplay as a buildup for the “drop” to transition between a slow and fast part.

# 2: How To Make Slow Gameplay

Slow gameplay gives the player time to think instead of relying on muscle memory. This includes where and why they click. You can be a lot more variable with the player’s click speed, as well as the gamemodes that you use. Additionally, try experimenting with complex gameplay. Making gameplay that is harder to sight read can add a lot more value to a part, forcing the player to think through what they are doing. You can make gameplay more complex by adding fake elements that the player must avoid interacting with; for example, let’s take a look at `Polargeist`. 

`Polargeist` is entirely in 1x speed, yet still manages to incorporate a ton of jump-and-fall gimmicks and patterns that add a sense of completeness to the level. Even as an easy level with 1.0 mechanics, Polargeist still remains an engaging level due to its clever use of small gimmicks and fake orbs/pads. 

Another example of complex gameplay would be to use slope physics. Slopes are sometimes unpredictable and convoluted, but there are a few mechanics that can add a lot of value to a slow part. For instance, forcing the player to think about whether they should ride a slope or jump off of it can add a lot of complexity to a part.

# 3: Example Gameplay

In this gameplay, I aimed to make the first half a bit more straightforward and have a more complex, less sight readable second half. As such, the first half is very barebones – every structure that exists purely serves a functional purpose for the gameplay. The most interesting things that occur here are the gamemode changes.

The second half mixes things up by including pads and orbs which you must avoid to complete the part. This forces the player to make some strategic decisions for how to play the part – at least, during the process of learning it. When making this gameplay I made the correct path first then added extra obstacles later.

Besides this, here are some other examples of slow gameplay.

One good example of slow gameplay is `ISO` by `Mzero` and `Xzer`  at 89 seconds. The slow part here uses a variety of moving objects that fade in and out to keep the player on their toes. There’s enough happening to eliminate the “boring” aspect of slow gameplay.

Another good example is the beginning part of `Soft Melody` by `Zoroa` . The toggle orb gimmick used is very easy to grasp, yet it adds a layer of complexity without adding much difficulty. The usage of minimal clicks in this part allows the player to focus on other aspects of the level, without drawing too much attention to keeping their icon alive.

One last example of slow gameplay is `Gloom` by `Optical` . The gameplay here includes a couple of fake portals, along with well placed black glow, forcing the player to think about the gameplay a little more.
