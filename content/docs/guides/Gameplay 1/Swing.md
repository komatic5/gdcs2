- When clicked, the Swing gradually inverts its gravity, following a curved path.
- The Swing is best used in slow, calm, open or wavy sections due to its floaty nature and characteristic trajectory.
- You can use Portals, Orbs, or the Gravity trigger to take advantage of the Swing’s physics, allowing for more interesting gameplay.

** **
Swing is a new vehicle introduced in the 2.2 update of Geometry Dash. It consists of a floating ball that can change gravity at any time. This gravity change is slow and projects a curvy path; the more inclined the Swing is, the more time it takes to completely change its gravity.

# Swing Gravity

When Swing flips its gravity, usually it feels heavy and slow, but this is actually what separates it from any other gamemode and brings a lot of potential new gameplay ideas.

A common thing done in many levels is to build gameplay that takes as much advantage as possible from the tricks and functions a vehicle has to offer. A very good way to use this with the Swing is to build as mentioned before, a gameplay that features curved paths.

Take as an example the 2nd Section made for the Swing from the main level [Dash](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LELzrqozNpI&t=31s>) by **RobTop** (34%), this section is made intrinsically for the Swing, as the gameplay is centered around the curved path the vehicle follows.

# Gameplay Readability

Gameplay built around Swing gamemode is typically better when the inputs from the player are **measured**, meaning __there is a set amount of inputs the player must do using the vehicle__. This usually applies, unless the section is wide enough for the player to fly around without getting confused. The reason why is because the Swing’s current gravity usually is not noticeable, and mindless fast inputs may confuse the player, ending in the opposite gravity that is required to keep in track. This makes the use of the vehicle unpredictable and makes readability worse, which is often a downgrade for gameplay to be enjoyable.

Examples of measured Swing gameplay include the 89% Swing section in [Placid Ivy Grove](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oFlCcaJ9hQ&t=59s>) by **truongwf**, and the two Swing sections in [Exotic Soul](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAGCUE4bmUM&t=55s>) by **Kiriia**. In both levels, the timings on where the player needs to tap are hinted using indicators, and in Placid Ivy Grove’s section, the path the Swing must follow is also indicated. This ensures the player knows exactly where the inputs must go and improves the gameplay’s readability.

On the other hand, Dash and Cosmic Dolphin by **DeeperSpace** both provide a good example of a wide area that allows the Swing to fly with no strict path. The gameplay is built in an intuitive way, without using any indicators; the player knows when to change gravity to go as the path shows. This type of gameplay gives freedom to the player, but normally this would be reserved for easier levels that let such gameplay sections work in the first place.

# Relation to Other Gamemodes

One thing is for sure, Swing is not, and does not behave like the Ship & Ball, or any other vehicle. There are several people who think about Swing in this particular way, and it's a pretty common mistake to build gameplay made for the Ship and place a Swing Portal for the section to be traversed. Even if it can traverse a section like other vehicles, the way it functions isn’t the same. Compare the Cube and Robot: they both jump when they are grounded, but the way they do it is different. The former requires only a single input and has a set height and distance on the jump, while the latter has a max height, but it can get the height it wants depending on the player's input time. This causes the gameplay for both vehicles to be different, even when the Robot could traverse most of the Cube gameplay. Remember, *the objective is to take advantage of the ways Swing does work and how it behaves to make enjoyable, challenging or unique gameplay around it*.

Also, it was mentioned earlier the fact that building gameplay around a vehicle should take advantage from the vehicle's functions, but this is said to specifically
make a path that takes into account the exact way the vehicle should go; in the Swing’s case, the defined path should consider the curves and gravity changes of the Swing. While this is true, the gravity and functions of the Swing does open up new design philosophies and new approaches to either give a new way to challenge players with tricks exclusive to the vehicle, or a new way to combine sections with other vehicles as well.

# Using Orbs and Portals

Orbs are the best way to fill the need for quick inputs, making them noticeable, controlled and useful. The physics of the vehicle allows for Orb and Portal interactions no other gamemode has. The floatiness of the Swing causes the Orb and Portal interactions to be extended in reach, while maintaining the same height as the other vehicles. As a side note, even though these interactions are different from the rest of the gamemodes, making a gameplay around Swing shouldn’t depend primarily on Orbs nor Gravity Portals.

# Song Representation

We have to acknowledge something first, **Swing gameplay is not meant to fit on every song and every situation**. Fast songs that require several quick inputs (at least more than 4) are often bad because of the nature of the vehicle. Since the Swing’s function is inherently slow, these kinds of situations make the vehicle feel like it's doing nothing, thus not accomplishing the objective to go in sync with the song. Using orbs to solve this may end up being *Orb Spam*, and although there isn’t a clear line on how much Orbs used would become Orb Spam, they need to be used in moderation.

However, there are a lot of song’s sections where the gamemode not only fits good enough, but makes this vehicle a solid choice among the others. This will allow for fitting gameplay for the Swing gamemode while making an enjoyable experience. Such sections include:

- Calm sections that don't require a lot of inputs but still need a flying sensation. See Golden Hour by **Zoroa**.

- Sections with quick, separated notes that let the Swing’s function to go in sync, while making the change in gravity noticeable. See Placid Ivy Grove.

- Sections with several few notes and separated notes, that allow you to mix in with Portals, Orbs, and Swing’s function. See the following example I made.

# Side Notes and Applications

When using a Dash Orb while on the Swing gamemode, the final result will be the opposite of the intended result. This means that when using a Green Dash Orb that is supposed to keep the gravity of the player, it comes out inverted, and when using the Pink Dash Orb, it comes out as the same gravity it had.

The Cyan Orb when interacted with, the gravity change begins with a very small curvature instead of instantly going diagonal.

Gravity Trigger is maybe hard to get used to, but as with every vehicle, it helps to set the pace, and so it should be something to have in mind. 

Dual Swing with different properties on each player can produce a lot of variety in a gameplay, whether one is smaller or has a different gravity, or both.
