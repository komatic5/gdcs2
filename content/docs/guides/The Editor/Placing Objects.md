# 2: The Build Tab

{{< img src="images/GDEmotes/Objects/Block.png" class="emote">}} This is where you can find objects to place. Objects are organized into lots of different tabs, which you’ll learn more about in [later guides](/docs/guides/the-editor/object-types). To place an object, *click on its button* in the Build tab, then *click* anywhere in the editor space.

# 3: The Edit Tab

This is where you can change an object’s location. Click on any object to **select** it. From here, you can use the following buttons to modify an object.

{{< img src="images/GDEmotes/Buttons/MediumArrow.png" class="emote">}} Use the **arrow buttons** to change an object's location.
- {{< img src="images/GDEmotes/Buttons/SmallArrow.png" class="emote">}} The small arrows move objects by *1/15th of a block*.
- {{< img src="images/GDEmotes/Buttons/MediumArrow.png" class="emote">}} The medium arrows move an object *1 block*.
- {{< img src="images/GDEmotes/Buttons/LargeArrow.png" class="emote">}} The large arrows move objects by *5 blocks*.

{{< img src="images/GDEmotes/Buttons/Rotate.png" class="emote">}} Use the **rotate buttons** to rotate an object. The arrow's direction shows which direction the object will rotate in, and the *number* shows how many degrees the object will rotate.

{{< img src="images/GDEmotes/Buttons/Flip.png" class="emote">}} Use the **flip buttons** to flip an object. The button shown here flips objects horizontally, while the other flip button flips objects vertically.

{{< img src="images/GDEmotes/Buttons/Scale.png" class="emote">}} Use the **scale buttons** to change an object's size. Objects can have any size between `0.25` and `4`. You can also modify an object's X and Y scale individually.

{{< img src="images/GDEmotes/Buttons/Warp.png" class="emote">}} Use the **warp button** to change an object's size and skew. Unlike scaling, there is no size limit here. This is explained more in the [Transforming Objects](/docs/guides/the-editor/transforming-objects) guide.

{{< img src="images/GDEmotes/Buttons/FreeMove.png" class="emote">}} If you want to drag objects into place, use the **Free Move** button. While this is enabled, you can use the {{< img src="images/GDEmotes/Buttons/Snap.png" class="emote">}} **Snap** button to align objects with the grid.

{{< img src="images/GDEmotes/Buttons/Copy+Paste.png" class="emote">}} If you want to copy and paste the objects you have selected, use the **Copy** and **Paste** buttons.

{{< img src="images/GDEmotes/Buttons/DeSelect.png" class="emote">}} If you want to stop selecting every object, click on the **De-Select** button.
