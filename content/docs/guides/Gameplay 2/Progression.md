- To keep the player interested in a level, it should progress over the long-run. For gameplay, this means varying the difficulty and intensity throughout the level.
- Good levels toe the line between boredom and anxiety when dealing with difficulty and intensity. This keeps players in the flow state over a longer time.
- Using easier to grasp gimmicks in the beginning of a level and then adding complexity later on gives the player a sense of control.

**1: Macro Flow**

Macro flow is a part of pacing that covers the long-term ways to make your level engaging. In order to keep the player's focus, the level should make larger changes that develop a central theme or idea. The idea of macro flow explains why some levels feel underwhelming at the drop, or why certain game modes or speed portals "fit" better than others.

The most important thing to look at is how the player will respond to your level over a long time period. When they’re first learning the gameplay, they’ll have to become familiar with how the level’s gameplay works, but once that process is complete it just becomes a matter of muscle memory. If you keep the rest of the level the same afterwards, that muscle memory will kick in and prevent the experience from becoming memorable. 

In short, keeping the player interested means giving the player new obstacles. These obstacles should still be fair, but switching them up a bit can keep the player’s focus.

The main factors you use to develop muscle memory are more long-term than the specific clicks in a level. Rather, they’re based on the level’s difficulty and how intense it is. You’ll want to make the level’s difficulty and intensity change over time as a result; keeping them constant will bore the player very quickly.

**2: Adapting To the Player**

While keeping the player focused seems like a highly abstract concept, progression and macro flow can be achieved using difficulty and intensity. When used correctly, difficulty and intensity can add depth to gameplay.

However, more difficulty or intensity doesn’t always mean a better level. Extremely difficult levels can be deemed frustrating, and an excess of intensity can be read as overbearing or overwhelming. Both of these cases cause a lack of interest and should be avoided. 

This first example shows gameplay that's too intense for the song it's paired with: https://fxtwitter.com/gpcreatorimages/status/1646182457593544708?s=20
While this level is simply too difficult to be enjoyable at all: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7AyAB0JKZ0

Both of these concepts can add value to a level, but only if used correctly. The next few lessons will go over the specifics of working with macro flow under those contexts. However, there’s still a general mindset you can use to develop anything that has to do with progression.

The diagram below shows the general idea behind progression, or *change*. If a level remains the same in difficulty throughout its duration, the player will have a tougher time paying attention, because nothing is challenging the player. On the other hand, if a level becomes too difficult, the player will have a bad time with the level, focusing on the frustration of failure, rather than the level’s intended experience. You want something in between these extremes, which gives you a range you can work with as shown below.

None

As player skill increases, so can the difficulty. Good levels should be able to challenge the player, but not enough to make the player give up. 

*This means you need to do a bit of planning before you start making your level.* Planning can involve a target difficulty and a general audience for the level. Using a chart to plan out your level’s difficulty and intensity on a part-by-part basis can be extremely beneficial. You can also use this when playtesting to match these factors to your level plans, but make sure to keep the amount of change in mind. Too much change can lead to a disorienting feel to the level.

**3: Applying Progression**

If you look at the graph in the prior section, you’ll notice that it’s organized from lower skill to higher skill. This applies generally to the target audience for your level, but it also applies to players who are learning the level. Remember that people will learn more about your level as they play it, so their skill will increase over time.

This means that you should start the player off with simpler concepts and gimmicks before moving to more complex ones. You’ll notice this sort of progression in most main levels. For example, Stereo Madness introduces the ship game mode with a wide space to test the new mechanic. Here’s a video that breaks it down a bit more. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q30cC7K21cQ

This process isn’t limited to just teaching the player mechanics, although that is one way to use it. It also applies to how your level changes as a whole. You’ll notice that most levels start out slower to get the player used to them, before increasing the intensity until it culminates in a “drop”. From there, that intensity usually stays constant or slowly changes until it either declines or increases again.

If you’re working with a song that remains calm throughout, your level should also be calm. If your song is intense throughout, you should make your level similarly intense. You can deviate from this structure sometimes, but that takes more experience to do well. These changes in long-term flow reflect how the song itself progresses, as you’ll notice in the examples below.

Following this process forces players to use their prior knowledge to pass new parts of your level. It also encourages them to notice changes to its difficulty and intensity, which creates a feeling of progress. That’s the entire essence of progression; to ensure that the player feels that they’re taking meaningful steps forward as they play, and using that to make your level interesting over the long run.
