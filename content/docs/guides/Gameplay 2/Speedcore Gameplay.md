- Speedcore is a genre of gameplay that’s focused on speed, intensity, and ordered chaos (at the sacrifice of readability and simplicity).
- Wherever you can, you should try to add player movement to your speedcore parts.
- The click pattern should be consistent yet also have variety, and focus on the strongest notes of the song.
- You can make your gameplay feel faster by moving the entire part towards the player, or by surrounding the part with slower gameplay.
- By splitting up the speedcore part into chunks, you can simplify the process to create efficiently.

# 1: Fundamentals

When making speedcore gameplay, there are some things that you must know. These things will help you **understand the concept** of speedcore itself as well as how to properly create it. *However, please keep in mind that these fundamentals are not set in stone;* Geometry Dash’s editor is a sandbox game, so you can always **bend the rules if it fits your needs.** Most of the rules of fast-paced gameplay apply here as well, so take note of that too.

## Player Movement

Speedcore is heavily focused on player motion. Even if it seems slightly unnecessary, you should add in **any form of vertical movement** like pads, slopes, player inputs, and portals. Doing this enhances the chaotic intense feel, which is what you’re aiming for. This is the main difference between speedcore and normal fast-paced gameplay, and easily the most important factor of speedcore. Think of vertical movement as the frequency of a wavelength. Speedcore has the highest frequency, whereas other forms of gameplay have average or lower frequency.

Remember that you do not always have to follow this rule exactly. The gameplay can differ depending on the song, for example if the song has a sudden pause. You should always keep the song in mind and feel free to bend the rules.

## Click Emphasis

In high BPM songs, it can be hard to decide which beats to click to. An obvious answer is to just find a consistent and satisfying click pattern, but you should remember some other stuff as well. One of the other things to remember is to **click on the stronger notes;** There are always some beats that have more power than others. You can determine if a note is strong or not by its sound (e.g., if there's a kick in the background that most of the other notes don’t have). 

You can also click on the first note of a measure (a phrase of a song), although this is harder to understand if you don’t have prior knowledge about music. You can split up songs into measures, and measures into beats. Usually the strongest beat of a measure is the 1st beat; followed by the 3rd, after that the 2nd, and then the 4th; however, you can also use the half-beat (aka an 8th note) right before the 1st or the 3rd note to enhance it. *This is important to know when choosing which beats to sync to.* There are some other notable ways you can induce movement, aka holds. In the image below, you can see a measure, the beats (also known as the count), and the notes that accompany it.

There are also notable “techniques” in speedcore that you can use to your advantage, being holds. **Holds** __allow for more variation in click pattern__ and also enable the opportunity to induce vertical motion, as stated before. For example, you can use miniwave holds into an array of portals so that a zigzagging pattern appears, or you can have the player hold and buffer cube clicks or spider clicks. 

## Creating Speed 

Speed obviously plays a big part in speedcore. Rather than just putting down a speed change, you can use other tactics to increase speed like moving the level towards the player. Speed is the change in distance over time, so therefore if the player moves farther relative to the gameplay in the same amount of time, you would feel faster. Most importantly, however, you can use contrast to enhance the impact of speed. **Contrast** is the __difference between two things__; the greater the difference, the more the impact. For example, to enhance a speedcore part to the max, you can have the gameplay around it be slow. Once you get into a speedcore part, the change in speed is abrupt and noticeable, and you subconsciously feel as if the part is a lot faster. This is why 2x speed can feel fast in a level primarily in 0.5x speed, and why it can feel slow in a level primarily in 4x speed. The best example is with color contrast. In the image below, you can see a yellow square put on top of a variety of different colored backgrounds. The yellow square blends in more on the yellow BG, white BG, and green BG because those colors are very similar, whereas it’s more obvious on the red BG, blue BG, and black BG.

## Duals and Waves

You’ll notice that a lot of speedcore layouts online have duals and waves, because those ones are the most dynamic. Duals offer 2 icons and therefore 2x the amount of chaos. However, you can use duals as another tool for variation or the main focus of a part, but you still shouldn’t force a dual just for the sake of it. 

Waves on the other hand are a lot more fun because they are snappy like the spider, but it doesn’t require player input to do so. The waves have solid trails, which creators often abuse to make dynamic patterns. Combine these two traits and you can understand that wave is one of the most versatile gamemodes for speedcore. You should still be careful with them, however. If you plan to click in them, it should be a buffer into the wave portal or a setup where the player is in the same spot on all attempts. If you’re going to be doing cool stuff with the wave, things can easily break if the player’s location isn’t consistent.

# 2: Thought Process

In order to help you understand, I’ve compiled an example of me making a speedcore part and I’ll be walking you through my thought process below. This will help you understand what it's like to create speedcore and what creators need to think about on the spot, *but keep in mind that this is completely subjective*. Other people can have completely different ways of creating and you don’t have to create speedcore like I do.

The first thing to note when creating speedcore gameplay is to split it up into chunks. This can help simplify your gameplay and help it not feel like a big mess. You can focus on the complexity of a small chunk in order to make each part unique and varied. Not every chunk has to feel entirely distinct, in fact, having chunks that are similar can help your part feel more cohesive.

<div style="width: fit-content; height: fit-content"><iframe src=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1446EPLwug2mMnTciFyZfPSGSf9eVnIiw/preview?usp=drivesdk></iframe></div>

The image above contains a small part of my speedcore layout I've built. I made sure to split the part into small chunks: the pad section on the left, a small wave section in the middle, and then the teleport portals on the right.

<div style="width: fit-content; height: fit-content"><iframe src=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gDcE74M9C_AOpW8ERZTukdh3ppoQph9A/preview?usp=drivesdk></iframe></div>

Here is another section, featuring teleport portals mixed in with other movement options. On a miniscule level, you can see that the gameplay is mostly simple, featuring pads and teleport portals and normal clicks, but once combined together, it feels completely different. If you’re ever struggling on speedcore and you feel as if your gameplay is way too simple compared to others, just know that the feeling once your chunks are put together is what matters.

Here is the final product extended past the 2 images above. As you can see, despite the chunks themselves being simple, it feels much more impressive in full. Once you finish the skeleton of the layout, make sure that you polish and structure as well, and remember you playtest your parts extremely carefully as speedcore is usually pretty buggy.

# 3: Examples

Of course, *you can’t truly understand material without a tangible source to take inspiration from*. Below here is a list of compiled speedcore layouts, as well as an analysis on what makes it good.

INSANE SPEEDCORE LAYOUT by ‘Bloodstorm’

Right off the bat, we can see the usage of holds. The first hold is on the first beat of the measure, and the icon is constantly moving as the wave through teleport and gravity portal. Every single second there are always movements, like the pads and the wave. The click pattern follows the guidelines set beforehand; focusing on the stronger first notes, and enhancing it by clicking on the 8th note right before it.

The Daybreak Will Never Come Again by ‘Chunlv1’

The click pattern for this part is a lot more spammy, but the amount of chaotic motion easily makes up for it. There’s a rapidly moving spider, a cube filled with pads, a dual combining pads and fast waves, and plenty of other things that just add to the chaos. This is a good example that you don’t have to perfectly follow the guidelines to make a successful speedcore part.

TERABYTE CONNECTION by ‘Quibbic’

This is possibly one of the most confusing and chaotic speedcore layouts, despite the gameplay being mostly in a straight path. The player movement is heavily based upon slopes and portals. The slopes give constant fast and repeatable motion, and the portals add onto the confusion. If you slow down the layout, you can see a whole world or tiny movements, and when you play at full speed you can really feel the intensity despite not understanding most of the movements. The click pattern is relatively tame, mostly clicking on the 1st and 3rd beat of every measure but still having variation throughout. This click pattern is consistent and still satisfying despite being mostly simple.

Ghost by ‘Bigthunder556’

The motion of this part comes from a combination of cube/spider clicks and pads. This example is excellent at showing other uses of duals; rather than making both icons have movements, it uses duals to enhance the movement of 1 specific icon by occasionally adding in more action which correlates with chaos. The song here has prominent drums and the level represents this amazingly as all the clicks are synced right on top of them.

MAXIMUS MACHINEGUN by ‘WillyGD’

This is an obvious pick. The creator expertly uses artificial speed here, by moving the level towards the player. There are constant teleport portals, mini portals, and pads, ensuring chaos 100% of the time. Click pattern-wise, it’s quite simple, being a satisfying metronome on certain beats.
