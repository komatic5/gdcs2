- The camera is a tool you can use to your advantage to enhance your gameplay.
- Lots of camera movements convey intensity, whereas little camera movements convey peace.
- You can make a part feel massive by zooming out, or make the player feel confined by zooming in.
- Make sure you can always see the gameplay with the camera, by balancing the size of camera movements or offsetting the camera to see ahead of you.
- Offset, rotation, and anchor are all camera tools you can use to your advantage to emphasize or highlight certain gameplay elements.
- Platformer mode opens opportunities for many camera tricks to arise, like full camera control, screen transitions, and camera locking.

# 1: Intensity

A good camera can help the gameplay feel intense, and vice versa. Usually, a rapidly moving camera gives a sense of ordered chaos and speed. By giving significant vertical movements to the player, you can emphasize parts of the song using this strategy. This also works the other way around, by using little camera movements to support a calmer part.

This is why most intense drop parts are suspended in the air; the camera can go up and down, making it possible for more and bigger camera shifts, whereas a part on the ground limits how far down the camera can go.

However, having insanely big and random camera movements is something you should try to avoid. Large camera movements can easily make the part unreadable and blind, which detriment rather than benefit the gameplay. Note that offsetting the camera behind the player can also have this effect.

- Waterfall by [cherry] team - This robot part uses a lot of camera movements, which multiplies the intensity tenfold.

- THE HILLS HAVE EYES by cometface - This first cube uses the ground as well as the lack of camera movements to convey a sense of peace.

# 2: Scale

Scale is also another thing that a camera can convey when paired with other elements. Zooming in and out gives a part its identity and can make you feel tiny in the vast world or like you’re cramped and in a tense situation.

Zooming in is a really good way to make a menacing part, as it slightly limits your visibility and makes you feel like you're in a tight spot. It can also show small emotions - like sadness or reflectiveness - as it focuses on the player. This is good for slow-timing levels or levels that want you to feel restricted and confined. Keep in mind that zooming in does make it harder to see things ahead of you, so always try to offset the camera in front of the player.

On the other hand, zooming out can help the level feel massive and make you feel insignificant, which is useful for setting up the atmosphere. Similar to before, zooming out can also show emotions like hope or happiness as it focuses on the world around the player. Zooming out does make the player look like it's moving slower, however, which probably wouldn’t work well with a fast-paced intense part.

- Rise Up by Astraa - The zoomed-out camera works wonderfully in tandem with the free-fly swingcopter and the massive structures.

- I Love You by Astraa - The song here sounds remorseful, and the gameplay represents it perfectly by zooming in slightly. Note that there's still space ahead of you to see where you’re going.

# 3: Camera Triggers

In Update 2.2, there are camera offsets, rotations, and anchors, which can be used effectively by the player to enhance gameplay. However, these three camera tools also suffer from the prospect of being abused to make unreadable gameplay. Here are some tips about each tool in order to help you take advantage of them and give your level the extra bit of spice it needs. **Keep in mind, most of these tips are applicable to platformer levels.**

## Offset

- Any movement of a camera should be saved for a transition rather than mid-gameplay. However, if you plan on moving the camera during a part, try to make it move slowly so as to not be jarring.
- One reason to offset a camera during gameplay is to highlight gameplay changes. This can be like moving the camera slowly upwards as the gameplay shifts upwards, or slowly shifting the camera in the other direction if the player is about to reverse directions.
- Tiny vertical camera movements can add a bit of energy to a part, making it feel bouncy.
- Make sure the camera is always offset IN FRONT of the player. This allows for more room to see the gameplay ahead of you.
- NEVER offset the camera behind you unless it's for something really specific. Offsetting the camera behind you does mainly harm and no good, as you’re just limiting the space for the player to see what's coming up.

## Rotation

- Slightly rotating a screen can emphasize progression. If you’re making a level about going up, rotating the screen slightly can help the player feel this sense of verticality, even if the gameplay itself is going straight. This can be used rather than constant vertical movement, as that can lead to blind gameplay.
- Rotation follows many similar rules to offset, so you can also use small camera rotations to help liven up the part.
- Similar to offsetting, you should also make sure you don’t rotate too much in the middle of a part unless it's a slow movement that fits with the level.
- If reversing the screen can be disorienting, so can rotating the camera. Try to avoid the player going on steep angles, which can be done by sticking to between 45 and -45 degrees from the player. 
- Fast rotations can be extremely hard to read. Try not to quickly rotate the screen as it can be confusing and make for an unenjoyable experience when playing.

## Anchor

- You can try anchoring the camera when the player isn’t the focal point of the gameplay. For example, you can anchor the camera to highlight a big room or a specific structure to make it stand out.
- Anchoring the camera to a point can potentially make a part of the gameplay visually easier to understand. This can help when having the camera simply track the player is ineffective.
- Make sure all the gameplay is visible when you anchor the screen to one specific spot.

## Examples

- Hollow Knight is a game with an exceptional camera. Take this boss battle for example. Before you head into the boss battle, the camera offsets to the left to highlight the arena, letting you know that something might be coming up. Once you enter, the camera anchors to the center of the arena, keeping all parts of the gameplay visible and helping the player focus on the space they can use to fight.

- Celeste also has a good camera. In this segment of gameplay, the player has to go past difficult obstacles to the right, which the game responds with by offsetting the camera in said direction. This is so that there’s more visibility and the player can react more easily to the gameplay. Then, as the gameplay shifts to be more vertical, the camera anchors itself to the center of the screen and offsets above the player, once again highlighting the part of gameplay that the player needs to see.

- FIGHT OF LIGHT is a Geometry Dash platformer boss fight level by TheMilkCat. This level anchors itself to frame your space to shift the focus onto the enemy. The camera never moves from this spot unless necessary, as it would probably disrupt the flow. However, around the midway point of the level, the camera quickly zooms in and rotates slightly to emphasize your progression throughout the level.

- Ori and the Will of the Wisps is the last example on this list. This part once again features camera offsets to the right, as the player advances in that direction. However, there are also camera zooms and other offsets to enhance the atmosphere. For example, when the player enters a giant wheel that rolls down a hill, the screen zooms out and moves upwards to truly help the player see the scale of the wheel. After this segment, it zooms in again to frame the new, slightly cramped space they’re in.

# 4: Platformer Mode

Although platformer mode shares a lot of the same concepts as autoscrolling, there are still unique things you can do with the camera. Here are some things you can do that would be harder to implement in autoscrolling.

**Full camera control** gives the creator access to __moving the camera wherever they want__, which in platformer mode can really shine. You can move the camera to a key or collectible, then back to the player so that they know what they’re looking for, or you can use the camera to survey the whole room and let the player know what's coming up.
- One of the new platformer levels in Geometry Dash uses a “screen surveying” tactic. The camera shifts around the room, showing players a bit of what they’ll have to go through.

{{< youtube ipK7vQ8gEZw >}}

Camera controls can also let you do **screen transitions**, which is basically when __the player enters another “room.”__ By turning the screen black and quickly moving the camera and player to a different location, you can give the player the effect of just entering a new area with new obstacles and atmosphere. 
 - In this level, the player falls through a cave, and a screen transition occurs. Immediately after, the level and song switches, which all combine to help the player feel like just entering a completely new part.

{{< youtube LxA4NJMiZ8o >}}

An obvious but useful technique is **camera locking** the screen to __frame a room or something else__. Locking the camera is a really easy tool in platformer mode; you can have all your gameplay visible, with a sense of progression each time you enter a new segment. It also helps the player focus on their surroundings rather than purely themselves. If the room is really big, you can alternatively unlock the camera but use the edge trigger to stop the screen from going past the edge. This is called “padding.” 
 - In the 2.2 trailer, there’s an example part to demonstrate the gradient trigger. The camera is locked to the center to draw attention away from the player and bring attention to the general area around the player, most notably the “light” that the gradient trigger helps simulate.
