- Triggers are objects that change the properties of other objects.
- Some triggers take a certain time to work, known as Duration. Most use Groups, which tell them what objects to target. Some even use special IDs besides groups too.
- To use triggers, decide which one you want, then place it down and set it up. Playtest to make sure the effect works as you expected.

# 1: What Are Triggers?

Triggers are objects that can change the properties of other objects. You can use triggers to make objects change colors, move around, rotate, and so on. In the editor, triggers are just colored circles with a tag and a number on them. However, when you’re playing a level, they are invisible.

At a low level, you can do very simple things with triggers, like in Stereo Madness where only the background and ground colors change. At the most advanced level, you can do seemingly mind-blowing things, like in HOW.

People have even made entire games inside of GD; some examples include Geometry Dash and MasterGame. Triggers made all of these levels possible.

# 2: Trigger Features

As you may expect, some triggers are easier to use than others. However, we can categorize them based on what features they have.

One of these features is duration; some triggers work instantly, while others may work over a period of time. __The time a trigger takes to work__ is known as its **duration**. You can see how long a trigger’s duration is by going to Editor Settings and enabling Duration Lines.

Another one is groups. **Groups** allow you to __specify what objects a trigger should target__, and are a part of almost every trigger. We’ll discuss them more in a few lessons.

And yet another one is **Special IDs**. Alongside groups, __some triggers need separate IDs to function properly__. For example, Collision triggers require a group and two Collision Blocks to function. This’ll be covered in later lessons.

# 3: How to Use Triggers

First, decide what you will do with the trigger. If you want to change an object’s color, use a Color trigger. If you want to move it, use a Move trigger. You have a lot of possibilities, but the simpler each action is, the better.

Next, place down the trigger and set it up. Each trigger lets you choose what objects it will target and how it will affect them. We’ll show you how each of the triggers works in each guide.

Finally, test if the trigger did what you want. Remember that some triggers don’t work without playtesting in the editor or in-game. You may need to adjust its options before getting a satisfying result.
