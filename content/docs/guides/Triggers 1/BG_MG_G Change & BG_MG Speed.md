# 1: Recap

In case you haven't read the editor guides, here is a quick recap of how backgrounds, midgrounds, and grounds work. Geometry Dash has a variety of backgrounds and grounds you can use, with midgrounds being added in Update 2.2.

To change any of these options, go to the :Settings: Level Settings page and set them through the UI given. Note that if you're playing on version 2.200 (such as being on mobile), adding a MG to your level will permanently lock you out of the editor.

# 2: :BGChangeTrigger: BG, MG, & G Change Triggers

These triggers let you change the BG, MG, and G currently in your level. Their UIs all look somewhat like this when you click :EditObject: Edit Object.

<div style="width: fit-content; height: fit-content"><iframe src=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LEq4LkGM-QMV_RgkJx-hPArIky8tkdsx/preview?usp=drivesdk></iframe></div>

When you click on the button in the middle, you'll be able to select a new BG, MG, or G for your level. You may also make these triggers Touch or Spawn Triggered of course.

# 3: :BGSpeedTrigger: BG & MG Speed Triggers

These triggers let you change the speed at which your BG and MG move.

<div style="width: fit-content; height: fit-content"><iframe src=https://drive.google.com/file/d/12W9r6DeNBNT3k-_VbFYT4zG_valVURiz/preview?usp=drivesdk></iframe></div>

The **Mod X** and **Mod Y** values are the same as in the Follow trigger and set the speed of the BG and MG. A value of 1 makes the BG move at the camera's speed, while a value of 0 makes it stop entirely.

By default these are set to 0.1, but there are other criteria which determine how fast they move - most notably the :TimeWarpTrigger: Timewarp trigger and your speed changes.

# 4: MidGround Trigger

You may also change the position of your level's MG using this trigger. As with the Move trigger you can input an offset, set a move time, and add an easing. As always, this can be Touch and Spawn Triggered.

# 5: Additional BG Changes

If you are bored with the backgrounds that GD offers, you can make your own custom ones. I won't go into detail here as it's outside of this guide's scope, but there is [another guide](https://discord.com/channels/414295025883545600/1086730133169262766/1086730133169262766) here which you can read for that.
