- Alpha triggers work by setting any group of objects to a set opacity and also the time it takes to fade those objects to said opacity.

** **
In Geometry Dash, you can use Alpha Triggers as a way to set the **Opacity** of any object.

Opacity refers to the transparency or visibility of any object *(ie. how “see-through” any object is)*. An opacity setting of `0.00` makes any object entirely invisible, and `1.00` makes any object fully visible.

**Fade Time** refers to the time it takes for any object to fade into the set opacity, in seconds.
Whether or not you want a level to fade to black, or if you want to make an object invisible, the alpha trigger is the best trigger for the job.
