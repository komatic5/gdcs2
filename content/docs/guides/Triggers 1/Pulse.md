- Pulse triggers change the color of a certain color channel or group for a set amount of time using the "Fade In", "Hold", and "Fade Out" sliders.
- In order to choose what changes color, you can toggle either of the Pulse Mode or Target Type options.

# 1: Pulse Trigger

The pulse trigger has a built-in color editor and multiple features:

- “Fade In” modifies the time it takes to fade into the color.
- “Hold” allows you to hold that color for an assigned time.
- “Fade Out” modifies the time it takes to fade out the color.

Additionally, there are two togglable options:

- Pulse Mode lets you set whichever color editor type you would like ("Color" which allows you to use a color wheel to set your desired color, or "HSV" which allows you to alter aspects of the existing color such as hue, saturation and brightness).

- Target Type sets the pulse trigger to either a color channel ID or a Group ID (Color or Group). Note that when selecting a group, you have the option to make it a main detail or a detail only pulse. This means the pulse will only affect the first or second color channel on an object, instead of both.

The video below shows a basic use of the pulse trigger in practice.
